# DAVIT

The Data Analysis and Visualization Tool (DAVIT) is a PyQt application designed for visualizing and analyzing HDF5 files, with Pandas as its primary engine. It allows HDF5 filtering by attributes, supports combination operations between dataframes, and can display extremely large data curves (>50M points) thanks to the built-in downsampling algorithm. It also supports fetching data from other sources like NXCALS.
